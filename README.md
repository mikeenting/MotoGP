# MotoGP Analysis

## Description
Projects related to analyzing historical MotoGP data.

----------
## Project 1 - Rise and decline of Japanese constructors in the MotoGP World Championship

Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional course, provided by [Coursera.](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)

## Project 2 - Create a dataset that includes all unique MotoGP circuits

Created a dataset that includes all unique circuits the MotoGP world championship has raced on since 1949. The dataset is shared on Kaggle. I created a notebooks to illustrate what it can be used for.

## Project 3 - Analyzing Marc Marquez's wins per circuit direction

To further illustrate the possibilities of the dataset created in Project 2 above, I created a notebook to analyze the distribution of Marc Marquez's wins across the two possible circuit directions, being clockwise and anticlockwise. I created an additional notebook that can be used to see the results of any other rider.

## Project 4 - Interactive dashboard to explore historical results per circuit

Using the dataset created in Project 2, this dashboard gives quick insights in the general information of a circuit (the number of races, year of the first and last race, number of corners), and the recent results. It also provides the top rider and constructors at that particular circuit. I use it to gain some insights before the start of a raceweekend.

## Project 5 - Active years per rider for each category (dataset)

To improve the notebook that looks at percentage of wins per circuit direction (created in project 3), I created a dataset that contains all riders and their active years per class.

## Ideas for future projects in order of priority
* What do the results of the first 3 races say about the eventual season champion?
* Which constructors are historically successfull at which circuits?
* Adding a 'wet race' indicator to race results
