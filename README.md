## Project 2 - Create a dataset that includes all unique MotoGP circuits

Created a dataset that includes all unique circuits the MotoGP world championship has raced on since 1949. The dataset is shared on Kaggle. I created a notebooks to illustrate what it can be used for.

## Project 3 - Analyzing Marc Marquez's wins per circuit direction

To further illustrate the possibilities of the dataset created in Project 2 above, I created a to analyze the distribution of Marc Marquez's wins across the two possible circuit directions, being clockwise and anticlockwise. I created an additional notebook that can be used to see the results of any other rider.

## Ideas for future projects in order of priority
* An interactive dashboard to explore race historical results at a certain venue 
  - Find some interesting insights before the start of a raceweekend
* What do the results of the first 3 races say about the eventual season champion?
* Which constructors are historically successfull at which circuits?
